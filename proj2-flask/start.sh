# Design notes:
# This is a shell script outside the Makefile so that we
# can make sure it is run by bash, with one shell process
# running the whole script.  Make uses a separate shell
# process for each line of a recipe, making it difficult to
# capture the process ID.  Also Make can use a different
# shell, and may act differently between Windows and Unix.
